# Big Data Processing System Overview

## System Flow Summary

### 1. External Data Ingestion
External users upload large data files to a secure landing zone using industry-standard tools. The system automatically detects new uploads and initiates the processing workflow.

### 2. Data Movement
Files are automatically validated and transferred to the main data lake storage, maintaining security and data integrity throughout the process.

### 3. Data Processing
Multiple configurable processing tasks execute in sequence, transforming and enriching the data according to business rules and parameters.

### 4. Review and Approval
Processed items requiring review are automatically identified and queued for user approval through a web interface.

### 5. Archival
All versions of data are preserved in a secure archive, maintaining a complete audit trail of changes.
